# _Vois Frontend Task Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the frontend task, including requirements, key features, and instructions for running the project.

## Task Description

The goal of this task is to create a simple map-box web application using ReactJS. The application should have the following pages:

1. User Registration Page
2. Login Page
3. User List Page
4. Map Page
5. 404 Page

The application should include authentication, user registration, user listing, and map visualization features.

## Requirements

- The implementation follows React best practices and the latest standards.
- The project uses Redux for state management.
- TypeScript and hooks are used for development.
- Styling is done using React Material UI.
- Two external endpoints are available to interact with: `/login` and `/register` for authentication and `/users` and `/polygons` for data retrieval.
- The map page displays a map using Mapbox as the base layer and uses DeckGL to visualize regions.

## Libraries used for Render map

npm install deck.gl --save 
npm install --save react-map-gl mapbox-gl @types/mapbox-gl

Mapbox GL JS is a Javascript library that uses WebGL to render maps and deck.gl is Uberâ€™s data visualization library that is built on top of Mapbox GL. Using these in conjunction will allow you to display a map with data overlays.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
