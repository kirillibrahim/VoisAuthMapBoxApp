# _Vois Frontend Task Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the frontend task, including requirements, key features, and instructions for running the project.

## Task Description

The goal of this task is to create a simple map-box web application using ReactJS. The application should have the following pages:

1. User Registration Page
2. Login Page
3. User List Page
4. Map Page
5. 404 Page

The application should include authentication, user registration, user listing, and map visualization features.

## Requirements

- The implementation follows React best practices and the latest standards.
- The project uses Redux for state management.
- TypeScript and hooks are used for development.
- Styling is done using React Material UI.
- Two external endpoints are available to interact with: `/login` and `/register` for authentication and `/users` and `/polygons` for data retrieval.
- The map page displays a map using Mapbox as the base layer and uses DeckGL to visualize regions.

## Libraries used for Render map

npm install deck.gl --save 
npm install --save react-map-gl mapbox-gl @types/mapbox-gl

Mapbox GL JS is a Javascript library that uses WebGL to render maps and deck.gl is Uberâ€™s data visualization library that is built on top of Mapbox GL. Using these in conjunction will allow you to display a map with data overlays.
